## 2026-09-16 — CP1 foundation + EDA scaffold

Completed:

- initialized the new GeoLife repository and CP1 package structure;
- separated exploratory notebook code from future production code;
- added raw-data/license/privacy guardrails;
- documented EDA questions and preliminary source-profile observations;
- added a Modal-oriented EDA notebook and memory-bounded trajectory summarization helpers.

Evidence/status:

- files are present on branch `cp1-eda-foundation`;
- GitHub Actions CI passed for the EDA foundation;
- raw GeoLife 1.3 data is mounted in Modal and Phase-1 inventory/imbalance EDA has now been executed.

## 2026-09-16 — Measured EDA Phase 1

Observed from the mounted release:

- 182 users;
- 18,670 trajectory files;
- 69 user folders containing `labels.txt`;
- strong long-tail imbalance: median 27.5 trajectories/user vs max 2,153;
- top 10 users account for 47.4% of all trajectories and top 50 for 84.0%;
- labeled users are heavier on average: 69 users account for 58.4% of trajectories;
- raw PLT parsing spot-check produced UTC-aware timestamps with no null timestamps in the inspected user-000 trajectory.

Interpretation and caveats are recorded in `docs/eda/02_initial_findings.md`.

Next evidence step: run the memory-bounded trajectory-level scan over all 18,670 files and inspect sampling, duration, distance, timestamp quality, altitude missingness, and speed/noise distributions before selecting cleaning or stay-point thresholds.
