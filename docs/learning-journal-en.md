## 2026-09-16 — Why GeoLife needs deeper EDA

GeoLife is not a small i.i.d. tabular dataset. It is hierarchical and spatiotemporal: points belong to trajectories, trajectories belong to users, users have very different observation periods, sampling rates vary, and geography/timezone affect interpretation.

Key lessons:

- verify dataset counts from files instead of trusting documentation blindly;
- inspect raw distributions before choosing cleaning thresholds;
- avoid loading every GPS point into one giant DataFrame when trajectory-level reduction is enough;
- evaluate user-history imbalance because Home/Office inference needs repeated behavior;
- treat transportation labels as auxiliary movement labels, not Home/Office ground truth;
- make timezone semantics explicit before using 'night' or 'office hours';
- treat mobility privacy as a system-design concern, not just a reporting concern.

Next learning target: execute the EDA, explain the main distributions, then justify candidate cleaning/stay-point thresholds from evidence.
